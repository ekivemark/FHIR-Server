								This server provides an implementation of the FHIR Specification as the basis for
								the implementation of BlueButton as a Data Service
								using a 100% open source software stack. It is hosted by HHS in the AWS Cloud.
							</p>
							<p>
								The architecture in use here is shown in the image on the right. This server is built
								from a number of modules. The base implementation is here:
								<a href="https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/">HAPI FHIR Project by James Agnew</a>
								, which is a 100% open-source (Apache 2.0 Licensed) Java based
								implementation of the FHIR specification.
							</p>
							<p>
								The source code for this specific implementation can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/ekivemark/FHIR-Server/">Ekivemark's GitHub</a>.
								This in turn is forked from the amazing work done by Gajen Sunthara: <a href="https://github.com/gajen0981/FHIR-Server/">FHIR Server</a>

								This server is regularly loaded with a standard set of test data sourced

								that you will need later, as we will be regularly resetting it.

							<p>
								This is not a production server and it provides no privacy. <br/>Do not store any
								confidential data here.
